This is a simple problem in AI.  Basically, you're trying to do a minimax
search.  If this is a "goal state" (i.e. an ACTUAL win, lose or draw), then
we're done.  If not, we examine all of the successor states, assuming that
our opponent will make their best move, and we pick the one that's best

Unfortunately, this is too slow for interactive use.  Certainly, I ran
out of patience after a minute.  However, thankfully there are a couple
of safe heuristics which work just fine with tic-tac-toe.

The first is that if you can win in this move, you should do so.

The second is that if the first heuristic doesn't work, then you should
see if there is any move that your opponent could make where they could
win on the next move.  If so, you should move to block it.
